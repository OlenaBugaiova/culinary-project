# Culinary Project
Some of my project ideas in the culinary field

### Recipe Manager "Taste it"
<b>Description</b> A recipe manager with additional functionality: menu planner, culinary event organizer, ingredients list generator for shoping, filter lists for diet & other purposes. It's organized as a social network with private/public accounts</br>
(Code is inclomplete)


### Meet & Eat with locals
Magic of testing homemade food in a new place, seeing decorations, artifacts of home life, learning about travel tips and neat local attractions, sharing stories</br> 

<b>Description</b> A website to connect travelers with locals for a homemade lunch or dinner</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Culinary, cultural, and travel experience exchange</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. My experience with CouchSurfing 2. Visiting a local's house for lunch during my trip to Texas in 2018</br> </br>
<b>How it works</b> Each person completes his/her profile. As a traveler, you search for a host in your next travel destination. Then you send a request, where you introduce yourself and explain why you selected this person. If the request is accepted you meet, eat and talk with the local. After the event, you and your host can leave a reference. The same person can be a culinary host at home and a visitor during the travel</br>
<b>The target audience</b> Travelers, gourmands, home cooks, open-minded people curious about travel, cultures, traditions, food</br> 
<b>Monetization</b> Additional paid features or contextual advertising</br> </br>
<b>How is it different from CouchSurfing?</b> It focuses on eating together. The time of the event is shorter. The format is lighter</br>
<b>How is it similar to CouchSurfing?</b> The website connects travelers with locals. It has references that can work as credits for request acceptance. Each user fills a profile and can choose among 3 modes: host, traveler, not accepting requests</br>
<b>Similarity to EatWith</b> After coming to the idea of "Eat with locals" I searched for similar websites and found the website EatWith. "Join local hosts near you or abroad for intimate dinner parties, hands-on cooking classes, and interactive workshops." The main difference is that you pay for your culinary experience there
