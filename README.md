# Culinary Project
Some of my project ideas in the culinary field

### Recipe Manager
<b>Description</b> A recipe manager with additional functionality: menu planner, culinary event organizer, ingredients list generator for shoping, filter lists for diet & other purposes. It's organized as a social network with private/public accounts</br>
(Code is inclomplete)


### Eat with locals
A magic of testing homemade food in a new place, seeing decorations, artifacts of home life, learning about travel tips and neat local attractions</br> 

<b>Description</b> A website to connect travelers with locals for a homemade lunch or dinner</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Culinary, cultural and travel experience exchange</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. My experience with CouchSurfing 2. Visiting a local's house for lunch during my trip to Texas in 2018</br> </br>
<b>How it works</b> Each person completes his/her profile. As a traveller you search for a host in your next travel destination. Then you send a request, where you introduce yourself and explaine why you selected this person. If the request is accepted you meet, eat and talk with local. After the event you and your host can leave a reference. The same person can be a culinary host at home and a visitor during the travel</br>
<b>How is it different from CouchSurfing</b> It focuses on culinary experience. The time of the event is shorter. The format is lighter</br>
<b>How is it similar from CouchSurfing</b> The website connects travellers with locals. It has references that can work as credits for requests acceptence. Each user fills a profile and can choose among 3 modes: host, traveller, not accepting requests</br> </br> 
<b>The target audience</b> Travellers, gourmans, homecooks, open-minded people interested in meeting, learning about different cultures, culinary and travel tips and traditions, unique local features</br> 
<b>Monetization</b> Paid additional features or contextual advertising</br> </br> 
<b>Notes</b> After coming to the idea "Eat with locals" I researched for similar websites. And I found the website EatWith. "Join local hosts near you or abroad for intimate dinner parties, hands-on cooking classes, and interactive workshops." The main difference is that there you pay for your culinary experience.
