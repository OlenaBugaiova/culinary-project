# Culinary Project
Some of my project ideas in the culinary field

### Recipe Manager
<b>Description</b> A recipe manager with additional functionality: culinary event organizer, menu planner, ingredients shop list generator, filter lists for diet & other purposes. It's organized as a social network with private/public accounts</br>
(Code is inclomplete)


### Eat with locals
<b>Description</b> A website to connect travelers with locals for lunch or dinner prepared by locals</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Culinary, cultural and travel experience exchange</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. My experience with CouchSurfing 2. Visiting a local's house for lunch during my trip to Texas. It can feel like magic testing homemade local food, seeing decorations, artifacts of someone's life, talking about travel tips and neat hidden local attractions</br>
