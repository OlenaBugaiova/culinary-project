# Culinary Project
Some of my project ideas in the culinary field

### Recipe Manager
<b>Description</b> A recipe manager with additional functionality: culinary event organizer, menu planner, ingredients shop list generator, filter lists for diet & other purposes. It's organized as a social network with private/public accounts</br>
(Code is inclomplete)


### Eat with locals
It can feel like magic testing homemade food, seeing home decorations, artifacts of someone's life, learning about travel tips and neat hidden local attractions</br> 

<b>Description</b> A website to connect travelers with locals for lunch or dinner prepared by locals</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Culinary, cultural and travel experience exchange</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. My experience with CouchSurfing 2. Visiting a local's house for lunch during my trip to Texas</br> </br>
<b>How it works</b> Each person completes his/her profile. As a traveller you search for a host for a lunch or dinner in your next travel destination. Then you send a request, where you introduce yourself and explaine why you selected this person. If the request is accepted you eat with local. After the event you and your host can leave a reference. The same person can be a host at home and a visitor during the travel.
