### Recipe Manager "Taste it"
<b>Description</b> A recipe manager with additional functionality: menu planner, culinary event organizer, ingredients list generator for shoping, filter lists for diet & other purposes. It's organized as a social network with private/public accounts</br>
(Code hasn't been completed)</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Keep track of personal recipes, navigate through them, organize personal and social culinary events</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. Desire to organize my list of recipes 2. Traditions of meeting families and setting the table for the holidays</br> </br>
<b>How it works</b> Each person creates his/her account and adds dishes into one of three categories: favourite, tasty, want to try. Dishes include information about ingredients, time to cook etc. and can have tabs like "soup". If a person likes some dish on the internet it can be parced automatically with the link to the source. Then a person can use services: filters, saved lists of dishes, calendar for menu planning for a period of time, ingredients list generator, event organizer</br>
<b>The target audience</b> Everyone who cooks at home and likes to explore new dishes</br> 
<b>Monetization</b> Additional paid features, private accounts, or contextual advertising</br> </br>


### Meet & Eat with locals
Magic of testing homemade food in a new place, seeing decorations, artifacts of home life, learning about travel tips and neat local attractions, sharing stories</br> 

<b>Description</b> A website to connect travelers with locals for a homemade lunch or dinner</br>
<b>Purpose</b> Culinary, cultural, and travel experience exchange</br>
<b>Inspiration</b> 1. My experience with CouchSurfing 2. Visiting a local's house for lunch during my trip to Texas in 2018</br> </br>
<b>How it works</b> Each person completes his/her profile. As a traveler, you search for a host in your next travel destination. Then you send a request, where you introduce yourself and explain why you selected this person. If the request is accepted you meet, eat and talk with the local. After the event, you and your host can leave a reference. The same person can be a culinary host at home and a visitor during the travel</br>
<b>The target audience</b> Travelers, gourmands, home cooks, open-minded people curious about travel, cultures, traditions, food</br> 
<b>Monetization</b> Additional paid features or contextual advertising</br> </br>
<b>How is it different from CouchSurfing?</b> It focuses on eating together. The time of the event is shorter. The format is lighter</br>
<b>How is it similar to CouchSurfing?</b> The website connects travelers with locals. It has references that can work as credits for request acceptance. Each user fills a profile and can choose among 3 modes: host, traveler, not accepting requests</br>
<b>Similarity to EatWith</b> After coming to the idea of "Meet & Eat with locals" I searched for similar websites and found the website EatWith. "Join local hosts near you or abroad for intimate dinner parties, hands-on cooking classes, and interactive workshops." The main difference is that you pay for your culinary experience there
